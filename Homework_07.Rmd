# 1
#Ongoing study: relationship between lecture and lab exam scores
#Hypothesis: if a student has a higher lecture exam score, then they will also have a higher lab exam score
#Pattern: positive slope of linear regression with significant p-value

# 2
n <- 40 #enrollment in the course

lecturen <- n #each enrolled student has a lecture exam score
lecturemean <- 80 #mean of four lecture exam scores in course
lecturesd <- 10 #sd of four lecture exam scores in course

labn <- n #each enrolled student has a lab exam score
labmean <- 40 #mean of four lab exam scores in course
labsd <- 5 #sd of four lab exam scores in course

#generate simulated lecture exam data (hypothetically independent variable)
lab_exam <- lecture_exam/2+rnorm(n=labn,mean=lecturemean/2-labmean,sd=labsd)
#generate simulated lab exam data (hypothetically dependent variable) from lecture exam data. Lab exams are half as many points as lecture exams, and I introduced some random normal variation based on the sd of the lab exam scores.
ID <- 1:n #identifier column
regData <- data.frame(ID,lecture_exam,lab_exam) #generate data frame

#Using the parameters below, I generated the following p-values over 10 trials. Thus, these realistic parameters generate significant p-values.

#lecturen <- 40
#lecturemean <- 80
#lecturesd <- 10

#labn <- 40
#labmean <- 40
#labsd <- 5

#simulated p-values (1.65e-09, 5.08e-10, 1.60e-06, 1.28e-05, 9.31e-09, 7.54e-05, 7.45e-09, 7.11e-10, 3.00e-08, 1.84e-06)

#6
#While changing the means does not impact the p-value of this linear regression, changing the variance does. Larger variance in labsd appears to decrease p, whereas larger variance in lecturesd appears to increase p.

#7
#The smallest sample size that consistently produces significant (<0.01) p-values is n=25 (n=20 had frequent, though not exclusivly, insignificant p-vaues).
